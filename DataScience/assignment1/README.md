## How to use LTI interface

While completing the programming assignment, you have to submit your assignment. In order to make submission, you have to create a notebook. When you created a Jupyter notebook, in the right top corner you could see a dropdown with tasks and a button "Submit assignment". You have to choose the appropriate task (the task that you have chosen from Coursera Interface) and press the blue button. 

After that you will see a popup window with notification that your task have submitted. 

After some minutes  you can press the button "Get status" to get the response from the grading system with submission status: your grade and results from the grading system server. To resend your submission, please, reload the tool from the Coursera Interface.


## Notes

* The sample datasets for assignments are located in local FileSystem at /data/.
* You can find demos for each week in the folder `demos`.
* The system grades standard output and error streams from the last non-empty cell.
* If you have clicked "Open tool" and received "404" or "405" error, please reload the page.

### Spark assignment notes

* In this case you shouldn't worry about stderr. It is enough if you will give only stdout in your notebook.
* You should eliminate extra symbols in output (such as quotes, brackets etc.).

### Some extra notes
To make your life easier, we highly encourage you to proceed as described below. While completing assignments divided into pieces (you will see them in one module such as Task1, Task2, ...):
1. For each subtask read the instructions carefully and follow the link from Coursera (see "Open Tool" button)
2. You will be redirected to playground environment where you need to prepare the solution to the problem. After you complete the experiments, submit your solution by choosing the appropriate task name in the dropdown menu and click "Submit assignment" button
3. After that you should save the notebook (.ipynb) locally by downloading it via File-->Download as-->.ipynb
4. This notebook you will use in the next subtask. You need to upload this notebook into the Jupyther environment (similar to the one you have worked with during the previous step).
