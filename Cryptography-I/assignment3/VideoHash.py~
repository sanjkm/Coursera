# VideoHash.py
# Program will take a video file as input
# It takes 1024 byte chunks of the file, starting from the end.
# It calculates the hash value
# of a chunk using SHA-256. Then, this hash is appended to the previous chuck,
# which is then hashed, and appended to the previous block until the
# beginning of the file
